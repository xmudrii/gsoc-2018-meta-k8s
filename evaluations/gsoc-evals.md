Google Summer of Code has three periodic evaluations. The following evaluations are from my mentors, [David Eads](https://github.com/deads2k) and [Dr. Stefan Schimanski](https://github.com/sttts).

## First Evaluation

sttts: Great progress and excellent communication behaviour (very active and we are always informed about where it goes). Very open for comments in reviews and open for suggestions.

deads: You take feedback very well; incorporating the changes and applying the lesson to other areas of code and docs. Willingness to explore and understand new areas and avoiding sentimentality about previous work are great traits.

## Second Evaluation

deads: Having the discipline to follow a process that starts with security in mind and building the prerequisite systems like CI first to prevent regressions makes it easy to engage and help in your repo. Impressive time management juggling this project, community engagement, and exams.

## Third Evaluation

deads: Great performance, impressive time management next to exams, great communication with us and the community (etcd issues, blogs). The demo went well and I think you could do even better in the future by watching good demoers and how they manage the space while waiting and how they lead up and show the meat of their presentation. Kelsey Hightower comes to mind as an example of someone who does a very good job.
